# 秋兴八首 (Autumn Stirrings) - Interactive Poetry Experience
### A Digital Exploration of Du Fu's Masterwork

**Presentation Duration: 6 minutes**
**Course: General Education - Chinese Art and Literature**

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Today I want to share how I explored Du Fu's *Autumn Stirrings* (秋兴八首) through an interactive website that helped me engage more deeply with classical Chinese poetry.

As we've learned in this class, Du Fu is considered one of China's greatest poets. In 766 CE, while exiled far from the capital Chang'an, he wrote these eight interconnected poems about autumn, memory, and longing. I created this digital project because I wanted to understand not just what the poems say, but how they work—their imagery, their historical references, and how Du Fu builds meaning through the Chinese language itself.

## Why This Approach? (45 seconds)

When I first encountered these poems in our readings, I found myself constantly flipping back and forth—checking footnotes, looking up historical references, trying to understand allusions to Tang Dynasty history and Chinese mythology.

Reading classical Chinese poetry involves several layers:
- Understanding what each character means
- Recognizing historical and cultural references (like Kunming Pool, the An Lushan Rebellion, or the legend of the Weaving Maid)
- Appreciating how Du Fu uses imagery—rivers, mountains, autumn leaves—to express emotion
- Seeing connections across the eight-poem sequence

I wanted to create something that would let me explore all these layers without losing the flow of reading. The goal was to make the poems feel alive and interconnected, the way they would have for Du Fu's original audience.

## The Interactive Features (1 minute 45 seconds)

The website brings together the literary analysis we've practiced in class with interactive exploration:

### **Trilingual Reading Experience**
You can read the poems in Chinese, English, or both side-by-side. There's also pinyin for pronunciation. This lets you choose your entry point—maybe you start with English to understand the meaning, then look at the Chinese to see Du Fu's actual word choices.

### **Understanding Historical Context Through Annotations**
Throughout the poems, key terms are clickable. For example:
- Clicking **"昆明池" (Kunming Pool)** explains how Emperor Wu of Han built this massive artificial lake for naval training—and how Du Fu uses it to reflect on fallen imperial glory
- **"紫气东来" (Purple vapor from the East)** opens the legend of Laozi and how this became a symbol of imperial destiny
- **"三声泪" (Three cries bring tears)** reveals the folk belief about gibbon calls in the Three Gorges

These annotations helped me understand what Du Fu's contemporaries would have immediately recognized.

### **Exploring the Chinese Language**
Each individual character is clickable, showing its etymology and evolution. This feature taught me how Du Fu builds meaning—for instance, the character 秋 (autumn) itself contains the radical for "fire," suggesting the season's decline.

### **Visual and Geographic Context**
- A **journey map** traces Du Fu's route from the capital Chang'an to his exile in Kuizhou—over 800 miles
- A **timeline** places the poems within the An Lushan Rebellion and its aftermath
- An **imagery analysis** section reveals patterns: how often Du Fu returns to rivers, mountains, chrysanthemums, and the lone boat

### **Immersive Design**
Falling autumn leaves, colors drawn from Chinese painting traditions, and smooth navigation create an atmosphere that matches the poems' mood.

## What I Learned About Du Fu's Poetry (1 minute 15 seconds)

Building this project forced me to engage with every line, every image, every historical reference. Here's what emerged:

### **The Architecture of the Eight-Poem Cycle**
The poems aren't random—they form a carefully structured meditation:
- **Poems 1-2**: Establish the desolate setting and Du Fu's nightly longing for Chang'an
- **Poems 3-4**: Turn to bitter comparison—his failed career versus successful former friends, and the political chaos in the capital
- **Poems 5-6**: At the center, vivid memories of Chang'an's imperial splendor and the pleasure gardens
- **Poems 7-8**: Reflect on monuments of past dynasties and Du Fu's own fading poetic powers

### **Recurring Imagery Creates Unity**
Tracking the imagery revealed Du Fu's technique:
- **Water**: Rivers, gorges, the Yangtze—representing both separation and the flow of time
- **Autumn markers**: Frost, falling leaves, chrysanthemums blooming twice—counting the years of exile
- **The lone boat**: Appears in Poem 1, symbolizing Du Fu's trapped state—moored but never arriving home
- **Architectural ruins**: Kunming Pool's stone whale, the Daming Palace, Flower Calyx Tower—once-glorious sites now empty

### **Personal and Political Intertwined**
Du Fu's exile is inseparable from the An Lushan Rebellion's devastation. His personal grief mirrors national catastrophe. When he writes about mansions with "new masters" or Chang'an like "a chess game," he's documenting the collapse of Tang civilization.

### **The Power of Compression**
Classical Chinese is incredibly compact. A seven-character line can contain: a landscape, an emotion, a historical allusion, and a grammatical relationship—all at once. This is why translation can never fully capture the original.

## How This Connects to Our Course Themes (30 seconds)

This project connects to several ideas we've explored in class:

**Art and Literature as Historical Documents**: These poems aren't just beautiful—they're primary sources for understanding the Tang Dynasty's decline, the trauma of the An Lushan Rebellion, and the experience of political exile.

**The Relationship Between Form and Meaning**: Du Fu's choice of the *lüshi* (regulated verse) form, with its strict tonal patterns and parallelism, isn't just technical—it creates a sense of order and control even as he describes chaos and loss.

**Cross-Cultural Translation**: My trilingual interface highlights what gets preserved and what gets lost when Chinese poetry moves into English. It's a practical exploration of the translation challenges we've discussed.

## A Quick Example (30 seconds)

Let me show you how one line becomes clearer through the interactive features.

In Poem 1, Du Fu writes: **"丛菊两开他日泪"**

**Literally**: "Clumped chrysanthemums twice bloom another day's tears"

**The layers**:
1. Click the line → Annotation explains chrysanthemums mark autumn, and "twice blooming" means Du Fu has endured two autumns in exile
2. Click **菊** (chrysanthemum) → Learn this character combines "grass" radical with phonetic element
3. The imagery section shows chrysanthemums appear across multiple poems, linking them together
4. The timeline shows 766 CE is indeed Du Fu's second autumn in Kuizhou

One line, multiple entry points for understanding.

## Reflections on Digital Humanities (30 seconds)

This project taught me that building something is a form of close reading. To create those annotations, I had to research every historical reference. To design the imagery tracker, I had to read all eight poems multiple times, noting patterns. To structure the navigation, I had to understand how the poems relate to each other.

Digital tools can't replace careful reading, but they can support it—making connections visible, providing context on demand, and allowing different paths through complex material. For classical Chinese poetry, which is so culturally and linguistically distant, these tools can help bridge the gap without flattening the poetry's richness.

## What's Next (20 seconds)

If I continued developing this, I'd love to add:

- **Audio recordings** in classical Chinese pronunciation (different from modern Mandarin)
- **Comparative translations**—showing how different translators make different choices
- **Connections to other Tang poets**—how does Du Fu's exile poetry compare to Li Bai's or Wang Wei's?
- **Student annotation features**—allowing others in the class to add their own observations

## Conclusion (20 seconds)

Du Fu wrote these poems 1,259 years ago during one of Chinese history's most turbulent periods. Yet his themes—displacement, longing for home, watching a familiar world collapse, feeling powerless despite having something to say—feel surprisingly contemporary.

This project helped me not just understand these poems, but feel their emotional weight. I hope it can do the same for others encountering Du Fu for the first time.

Thank you. I'm happy to take questions or show you the website.
