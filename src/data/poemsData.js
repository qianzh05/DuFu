    annotations: {
      0: { term: '玉露', title: 'Jade Dew (玉露)', description: 'The white autumn frost, metaphorically called "jade dew" for its glistening purity. It marks the onset of autumn\'s killing cold that withers the vibrant maples.' },
      1: { term: '巫山巫峡', title: 'Wu Mountain & Wu Gorge (巫山巫峡)', description: 'Famous landmarks of the Three Gorges region near Kuizhou. In Chinese poetry, Wu Mountain is associated with dreams and longing, from the ancient tale of King Xiang of Chu.' },

    analysis: 'The opening poem establishes the desolate autumn atmosphere of the Three Gorges. Du Fu masterfully interweaves natural imagery with personal emotion—the dying maples mirror his own decline, while the moored boat embodies his trapped longing for home.'

    analysis: 'This poem captures Du Fu\'s nightly vigil of longing. The contrast between his lofty aspirations (serving at court, journeying like Zhang Qian) and his reality (sick, isolated, listening to mournful gibbons) creates profound pathos.'
