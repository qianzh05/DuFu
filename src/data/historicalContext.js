  summary: 'In 766 CE, Du Fu found himself in Kuizhou, a remote garrison town in the Three Gorges region. The An Lushan Rebellion (755-763) had devastated the Tang Empire, killing millions and permanently weakening imperial power. Though the rebellion was suppressed, warfare continued along the borders. Du Fu, now 55 and in failing health, was far from Chang\'an—the magnificent capital he had known in his youth. These eight poems, written in autumn, weave together personal grief and national tragedy into what many consider the supreme achievement of Chinese regulated verse.',
  duFuBio: 'Du Fu (712-770), styled Zimei and self-titled "The Old Man of Shaoling," is revered as the "Poet-Sage" (诗圣). Born into a scholarly family, he spent years pursuing an official career with little success. His brief service under Emperor Suzong ended in exile. The final years of his life were spent wandering the southwest, creating poetry of unparalleled depth and technical mastery. He died on a boat on the Xiang River, possibly of illness or food poisoning, having spent his last years in poverty.'
